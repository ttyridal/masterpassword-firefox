        <h3>Users of OS' key-vault</h3>
        <p>If you're using, or want to use, GNOME Keyring, KWallet, OSX Keychain or Windows Password Vault to store your master key,
        you'll need to download a separate helper app. Please refer to
        <a href="https://github.com/ttyridal/masterpassword-firefox/wiki/Webextensions" target="_blank">the wiki</a> for further information.

        <h3>Changes since v2.9.5</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Implement manifest v3. This is a chrome requirement and other browser would likely follow. mv3 has no practical
            implcations for the use of masterpassword, but should in theory make life for rouge extensions harder.
        <li>Minor bug fixes
        <li>Public Suffix List updated
        </ul>
