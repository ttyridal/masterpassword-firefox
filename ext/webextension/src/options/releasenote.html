        <h3 style="margin-top:2em">New data format</h3>
        <p>
        <a name="details"></a>
        This version of MasterPassword changes the internal representation for sites. This is done for a couple
        of reasons. First, the export file can only represent a sitename once. The addon could previously have
        a sitename with different configurations registered on different websites.<p>
        Example:<br> You use your google account with the site-name set to google.com and generation set to 2.
        You configured this when visiting gmail.com (the url you where at when opening masterpassword).<br> At a
        later time, you visit youtube.com and you want to login with your google account.<br>
        Previously you would have to enter the settings again. google.com at gmail.com and youtube.com was
        considered two unrelated things. This is no longer the case. There can only be <i>one</i> google.com
        site-name, and when you change the site-name to google.com (when visiting youtube) masterpassword will give
        you that the correct setting, with the generation correctly set to 2. And, if you update the generation to 3,
        it will change in all places where you use google.com as a site-name.<br>You can observe in the
        configuration/stored-sites, that google.com will be matched to both youtube.com and gmail.com.<br>
        You can of course still have multiple google accounts, user1@google.com, user2@google.com etc.

        <p>
        Furthermore, the new representation is better suited for working around storage limitations imposed by
        the browser.
        <p>
        Please head over to the configuration view to execute the upgrade.
