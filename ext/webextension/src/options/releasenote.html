        <h3 style="margin-top:2em">New data format</h3>
        <p>
        <a name="details"></a>
        This version of MasterPassword changes the internal representation for sites. This is done for a couple
        of reasons. First, the export file can only represent a sitename once. The addon could previously have
        a sitename with different configurations registered on different websites (ie. sitename google.com could
        have different generation number when visiting google.co.uk and google.com).
        <p>
        Furthermore, the new representation is better suited for working around storage limitations imposed by
        the browser.
        <p>
        Please head over to the configuration view to execute the upgrade.

        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
